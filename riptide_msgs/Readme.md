# The Riptide Messages Package
This package contains custom ROS messages (structs of data that get passed between ROS nodes) utilized by the `riptide_software` platform. These messages relate to: sensor data, low-level and high-level commands for the control system, high-level commands for control of manipulators, and task-related information.
